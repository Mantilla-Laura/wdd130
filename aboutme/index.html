    <h2>Laura Mantilla</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Laura. I am from Colombia, currently living in Malta and pursuing a Bachelor in Web Design and Development. Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, writing, watching series and movies with my friends and staying at the beach when the weather is good.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church my whole life, my parents became members when they were teenagers so that was a huge blessing for me. I am the second one of 4 siblings (3 daughters, 1 son) and right now I am serving as the First Counselor of the Primary in my branch. I love lots of scriptures but this one has been particulary helpful for me these days: "5 Now therefore, if ye will aobey my voice indeed, and keep my bcovenant, then ye shall be a cpeculiar dtreasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine."(Exodus 19:5). It is great to know we are Heavenly Father's treasure and how much He blesses us because of that great love He feels for us, this has given me so much confidence in Him in order to follow His ways when maybe they are not too similar to mine.</p>
