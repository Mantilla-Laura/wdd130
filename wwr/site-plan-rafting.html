    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this webpage is to provide detailed and relevant information about what Whitewater Rafting is and why it is an exciting activity to do with family and friends (achieving this point by showing testimonies of the clients with exciting images), with the idea of selling the different Rafting plans available. We are looking to show the people this activity can be fun and make them understand that the company always provides the correct security measures for them, their families, and friends. Since it is designed for people older than 6 years old, it must be appealing to them and provide the information in a simple yet clear way.</p>

Their principal needs are to have a good time with their couple, family, or friends, go out of their routine, and have a scape of their regular agenda to focus on the fun and rush of the experience.
